<h1>TIL: How to bodge a blog from scratch</h1>

<p>Hello, and welcome to the first serious post on this blog of mine! I'm gonna cut to the chase and talk a bit about the behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I've been wanting to make a blog for some time, mainly to publish notes and give out updates on my projects.</p>

<p>But everytime i looked up stuff like <code>how 2 setuPP jekyll with my poopoo html</code> i was put off by the tutorials. Heck, I tried following one and it just didn't work.</p>

<p>Another thing i dislike about Stuff like Hugo and Jekyll is that, to run them, a standalone webserver is needed.</p>

<p>And, while, yes I do have the technical skills to set one up (It really isn't hard, at all.) I just felt that a webserver for my shitty blog would be overkill.</p>

<p>(Also I'd need to set up stuff on GitHub, which annoys me.)</p>

<p>So, I thought of parsing Markdown files into html and then showing those.</p>

<p>"It would only require a script and some time" - I thought to myself.</p>

<p>And I was... <em>somewhat</em> right, actually.</p>

<p>Why somewhat? because i can't <code>bash</code> were it for the life of me.</p>

<p>It's just... so unnatural to me. The problem mainly arose when i got to parsing a JSON into a dictionary, and found out that bash doesn't have those.</p>

<p>So, being a python shill, that's what i went with;</p>

<p>And that's why the write script calls <code>python3 index-man.py</code>, because I felt that learning <a href="https://linuxhint.com/associative_array_bash"><em>Associative Arrays</em></a> were too much of an issue for something supposed to be a quick bodge.</p>

<p>I also initially wanted to parse markdown myself, but got lazy and opted for <a href="https://github.com/chadbraunduin/markdown.bash/">markdown.bash</a></p>

<p>I plan on eventually<sup>TM</sup> porting <code>index-man</code> into bash, but for now...</p>

<p>I'll just focus on fixing my website. And maybe keep working on <a href="https://envyniv.github.io/Project-Hope/">Last Hope</a>.</p>

<p>~~Hopefully those two html tags i used for a joke don't break the whole thing~~</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>Funnily enough, as soon as I saved and wrote tags, the whole thing broke. Turns out I didn't write the script I use in my aliases properly. Should be fixed.</p>

<h2>Edit 2</h2>

<p>Above happened 15 more times. I hate everything</p>

<h2>Edit 3</h2>

<p>Refactoring some stuff - I think i broke something
```json</p>

<pre><code>
{
"tags": {
  "til": {
    "{": "raw/post-index.json"
  },
  "blog": {
    "{": "raw/post-index.json"
  },
  "test": {
    "{": "raw/post-index.json"
  }
},
"by-year": {
  "<attribute 'year' of 'datetime.date' objects>": {
    "<attribute 'month' of 'datetime.date' objects>": {
      "<attribute 'day' of 'datetime.date' objects>": {
        "{": "raw/post-index.json"
        }
      }
    }
  }
