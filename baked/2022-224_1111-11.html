<h1 id="TIL">TIL: How to bodge a blog from scratch</h1>

<p>
Hello, and welcome to the first serious post on this blog of mine! I'm gonna cut to the chase and talk a bit about the behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
I've been wanting to make a blog for some time, mainly to publish notes and give out updates on my projects.
</p>

<p>
But everytime i looked up stuff like <code>how 2 setuPP jekyll with my poopoo html</code> i was put off by the tutorials. Heck, I tried following one and it just didn't work.
</p>

<p>
Another thing i dislike about Stuff like Hugo and Jekyll is that, to run them, a standalone webserver is needed.
</p>

<p>
And, while, yes I do have the technical skills to set one up (It really isn't hard, at all.) I just felt that a webserver for my shitty blog would be overkill.
</p>

<p>
(Also I'd need to set up stuff on GitHub, which annoys me.)
</p>

<p>
So, I thought of parsing Markdown files into html and then showing those.
</p>

<p>
"It would only require a script and some time" - I thought to myself.
</p>

<p>
And I was... <em>somewhat</em> right, actually.
</p>

<p>
Why somewhat? because i can't <code>bash</code> were it for the life of me.
</p>

<p>
It's just... so unnatural to me. The problem mainly arose when i got to parsing a JSON into a dictionary, and found out that bash doesn't have those.
</p>

<p>
So, being a python shill, that's what i went with;
</p>

<p>
And that's why the write script calls <code>python3 index-man.py</code>, because I felt that learning <a href="https://linuxhint.com/associative<em>array</em>bash"><em>Associative Arrays</em></a> were too much of an issue for something supposed to be a quick bodge.
</p>

<p>
I also initially wanted to parse markdown myself, but got lazy and opted for <a href="https://github.com/chadbraunduin/markdown.bash/">markdown.bash</a>
</p>

<p>
I plan on eventually<sup>TM</sup> porting <code>index-man</code> into bash, but for now...
</p>

<p>
I'll just focus on fixing my website. And maybe keep working on <a href="https://envyniv.github.io/Project-Hope/">Last Hope</a>.
</p>

<p>
<strike>Hopefully those two html tags i used for a joke don't break the whole thing</strike>
</p>

<p>
Funnily enough, as soon as I saved and wrote tags, the whole thing broke. Turns out I didn't write the script I use in my aliases properly. Should be fixed.
</p>

<p>
Above happened 15 more times. I hate everything
</p>

<h2 id="Edit 3">Edit 3</h2>

<p>
Refactoring some stuff - I think i broke something
