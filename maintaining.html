<p><em>My experience maintaining this blog so far</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Most of these last few days has been dedicated to getting this blog <em>just right</em>.</p>

<p>Down to the tiniest tag inaccuracy or css imperfection (funny, I still have to fix tags)</p>

<p>It's been a draining process so far; But I'm fine with the hurdles, the "growing pains" i've met so far:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Post titles don't appear in the index page!!!!!!
  WHYYYY?!?!??!?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which, btw, i ended up fixing by changing the python script:</p>

<pre><code>for post in posts:
  with open(post, 'r') as file:
    title = file.readline().rstrip().removeprefix("# ")
    file.close()

  with open(post, "a") as file:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>before, I only had the <code>with open(post, "a+") as ...</code></p>

<p>which, while would work for everything else, it didn't work for reading the first line</p>

<p>TIL: <code>a+</code> puts the cursor at the end of the file <em>for both reading, and writing</em></p>

<p>might sound obvious, but i had made an error in comprehension and thought that, while the cursor for <em>writing</em> would be at the bottom,</p>

<p>the one for <em>reading</em> would be at the top.</p>

<p>Funnily enough i did search it up, and got no results, either i'm the only dumb <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherfucker">mf</a> in the python programming landscape, or i just typed my query wrong and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">ddg</a> didn't get what i was looking for.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My scripts save shit in the wrong places.
  I just formatted my hdd trying to save an HTML file. heh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... Ok. That didn't happen. not while making this at least.</p>

<p><s>I was trying to automate compilation for <a href="https://envyniv.github.io/Project-Hope">LH</a> releases, it was over a year ago.</s></p>

<p>Overall, despite the initial, primal rage that awakens within me when my scripts crash, I'm having tons of fun making this; The dopamine hits I get after something miniscule works properly more than make up for all gripes.</p>

<p><s>Hell, now that I have this, I iust might delete <a href="https://twitter.com/domi_turnell">twitter</a></s></p>

<p>Also, I'm really enjoying writing blog posts. I could get used to this.</p>

<p>(Y'know, the fancy menus that you can click on that lead you to different parts of a page, right? I'm introducing those next update!!!)</p>

<p>(...)</p>

<p>(maybe, that would require me editing the markdown parser.)</p>

<p>Dunno when i'm gonna start working on that, but for now, I need to take a break from this thing's drunkenly bodged infrastructure.</p>

<p>Also, i've replaced markdown.bash with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"><em>the</em> markdown parser</a></p>

<p>See you next post,</p>
