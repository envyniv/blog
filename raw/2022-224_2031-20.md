While the old way of browsing the site (not doing so) and interacting with the website
(not doing so, either)

was pretty cool, the site felt... incomplete, y'know? it lacked that

```
    I WANT YOU
    CUZ YOU GOT THAT SOMETHING
    THAT I NEED IN MY LIFE
    GIVE IT TO ME
```

So i decided to add a makeshit html calendar, automatic dating and tagging of markdown
files, and...

[TAG BROWSING!](post-index.html#TAGS)

Overall, I'm really excited for this. I hope this works.

I've also fundamentally changed how the website works.
Instead of displaying a page where `latest.html` is embedded, now every blog page embeds the website header and footer.

Also I've changed the color scheme again.

I really need to figure out how to declare colors as variables in the css file.

I'm sick of typing `#420069` for the 10.000th time

`NOTE:` the python script has gained 500% `for X in Y:`-ness. I kinda need to fix that.

Either I end up fixing it or in a couple of years i'm gonna have to wait for the heat
death of the universe for the damn index page to compile.
